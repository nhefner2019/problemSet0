Simple math functions from Problems 0 - 8. Each function has test cases in ps0-runner.py file that show that the function works. Below are the credentials for each function.


0. Write a boolean function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns True if the number is even, False if it is odd. It is common to call functions like this is_even.

1. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns the number of digits in it.

2. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns the sum of its digits.

3. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns the sum of all the integers that are less than the given number.
For example: sum_less_ints(3) → 3, which is 1 + 2
         sum_less_ints(5) → 10, which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4

4. Write a function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns its factorial.
For example: factorial(3) → 6, which is 3!
         factorial(5) → 120, which is 5!

5. Write a boolean function that takes two positive integers as parameters and figures out whether the second number is a factor the first. In other words, returns true if the second number divides into the first number evenly, and false otherwise.

6. Write a boolean function that takes an integer greater than or equal to 2 as a parameter and returns whether the number is a prime.

7. Write a boolean function that takes a positive integer as a parameter and returns whether the number is perfect. A perfect number is a number that equals the sum of proper its proper factors. A proper factor is any factor except the number itself.  
For example: isPerfect(6) → True, because 6 = 1 + 2 + 3.

8. Write a boolean function that takes a positive integer as a parameter and returns true if the sum of the digits of the number divides evenly into the number, false otherwise. You MUST call the sumDigits function you wrote in question 2 to define this function.
